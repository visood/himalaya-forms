Let us load the `Python` environment that we will need for our
discussion,

``` elisp
(pyvenv-activate "~/.vmgr_repo/py310/")
```

Let us setup an interactive `Python` session where we can run the code
developed here.

``` jupyter
print("Welcome to EMACS Jupyter")
```

Nestled in the Western Himalaya, the Parvati valley emerges where the
Pir Panjal and Great Himalayan ranges converge, Here the valley splits
the Kullu mountains like a deep gash, its formation guided by tectonic
faults where one mountain chain thrust over another and carved by
millennia of glacial ice and rushing waters. At dawn, when the first
light catches the snow-draped peaks of Deo Tibba and Pin Parvati, the
valley transforms into a natural amphitheater of light and shadow. The
valley reveals its dramatic geologic heritage - where metamorphic
gneisses of the Greater Himalayas meet the younger rocks of the Pir
Panjal. The river below, named after the goddess Parvati, has carved its
course along structural weaknesses, tumbling through narrow gorges and
over worn boulders, its jade waters carrying both glacial silt and
stories of the mountains' violent uplift.

This landscape, where thermal springs burst from deep tectonic faults
and cannabis grows wild on abandoned terraces, represents the complex
interplay of geological forces, ecological adaptations, and human
aspirations that characterizes the entire Himalayan range. Modern man
must have set foot in the Himalaya before 10,000 years ago. Over the
millennia they settled all habitable corners of Earth's tallest mountain
ranges. The Himalaya suffered human presence, with deforestation turning
the Tibetan plateau to a cold desert. However, human expansion was
always limited by the extreme unpredictability of Himalayan weather and
geology. Until we arrive in the modern age. Today, as motorable roads
reach deep, hydroelectric projects dam the sacred waters and concrete
structures replace traditional timber homes, the valley embodies a
crucial question: how do we reconcile our need to experience, understand
and document these mountains with our impact upon them? Despite the
sublime experiences they inspire in an individual, modern humanity's
*common-market-interest* has been nothing but detrimental to the
mountains.

What does that mean if we travel through the mountains today? What shall
we experience? What will inspire us? Computing biodiversity data, or
climate data for the Himalaya will definitely be a good learning
experience by itself. There must also be several unresolved scientific
problems in Himalayan geology, hydrology, meteorology, climatology, or
biology. They should be interesting to read and understand using
computer models. However, these are *applications* of scientific
methods. I am more interested in elucidating the scientific methods
themselves — mostly to develop my own understanding. Our travels will
provide us ample examples to create learning material in the form of
computational notebooks, interactive webpages and info-graphics.

I seek to capture not just the mechanics but the music of the
mountains - from the crystalline patterns in their stones to the
rhythmic cycles of their ecosystems. Through computational art and
scientific modeling, I aim to express how life, from the smallest lichen
to human settlements, is inseparable from the mountain geology,
hydrology, and climate. I am interested in shapes and rhythms of both
the natural and imagined worlds. I have studied computational models for
the reconstruction and simulation of a mammalian brain. We can apply a
similar approach to reconstruct and simulate a mountain ecosystem. The
goal is not merely academic scientific development. Many such accounts
exist in the literature. I want to also appreciate the sublime that
Himalaya inspires in us. I want to develop a personal expression of her
sheer beauty using computationally generated art. I want to capture the
colorful patterns of it's stones, streams, and snows, and the rhythms of
its flora and fauna. Using their stark example, I want to express, in
code, and in art, how life is inseparable from air, land, and water. I
want to show how biology responds to geological challenges. I want to
show how human imagination responds to a towering geography. I want to
show how mankind has become a mightier force than terrestrial geology.
We will need modeling and data analyses — but those are just numbers. We
will also need art so that our audience can feel the beauty, what it
could have been in the past, and what it would mean when it is lost.

# Principles

Let us summarize the principles that will guide our journey,

1.  To discover, experience, and learn — no pre-planning.
2.  To explore from the perspective of a single human animal, developing
    a first-person narrative from my own experiences.
3.  To view human intervention as it is — as another *geological-scale*
    force that natural living systems have to struggle against for
    survival.
4.  To evolve observation methods and approaches organically as we
    discover natural wonders of Himalaya.

How can we begin to understand as we embark on our journey? What
observation, art, and analysis methods shall we develop?

- Computational tools that help us understand patterns that exist
  independent of human presence, and how they transform when humans
  intervene
- Develop metrics that are not anthropocentric to measure and represent
  mountain ecosystems
- Capture the sublime natural beauty through code without imposing human
  aesthetic preferences — keeping them minimal

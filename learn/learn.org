* Landscape Simulation Modeling

Here is the overview of a book on landscale simulaion modeling.
#+begin_quote
We start with several chapters that describe the essential tools and steps that are required to build a simulation model of a spatially explicit system using the land- scape modeling approach.
In Chapter 2, Maxwell et al. describe the Spatial Modeling Environment (SME), the software package that can be used to put together the local descrip- tions of processes and models into a spatial framework. This is a fairly technical chapter that also walks the reader through an example of a simple spatial model and explains the whole process in much detail. The development of SME went through a whole series of versions, starting from the early implementations on Macintosh computers to the latest more sophisticated SME3 that runs in a variety of operating systems (UNIX, Linux, Windows) and includes a Java-based user in- terface. The overall concept remained the same: The SME provides the function- ality to translate the models formulated in user-friendly modeling packages, such as STELLA, into a compilable programming language (C, C) and to link the local descriptions with spatial data and algorithms. A Modeling Collaboratory is described (i.e., a collection of hardware and software tools that can be used for the exploration of collaborative modeling techniques and the development of process-based spatial models, as well as for transparent access to high- performance computing facilities. This infrastructure is expected to open the sim- ulation arena to a much wider set of participants and facilitate the application of computer modeling to the study and management of natural systems.
In Chapter 3 Voinov with coauthors describes how the unit model, the spatially uniform building block of a spatial model, can be constructed. Fitz et al. (1996) have previously developed the General Ecosystem Model (GEM). Here, this ap- proach is further extended and generalized. An even more flexible modular struc- ture is created that can be modified and adapted to suit the requirements of partic- ular case studies and applications with minimal redundancy. The modular approach takes advantage of the Spatial Modeling Environment (described in Chapter 2) that allows integration of several unit models (which can be created in user-friendly modeling environments such as STELLA) with C user code. The modules are archived into a Library of Hydro-Ecological Modules (LHEM), which is available over the Web and includes modules that simulate hydrologic processes, nutrient cycling, vegetation growth, decomposition, and so forth both locally and spatially. Using the LHEM, the Patuxent Landscape Model (PLM) (see Chapter 8) was built to simulate fundamental ecological processes in the wa- tershed scale driven by temporal (nutrient loadings, climatic conditions) and spa- tial (land use patterns) forcings. Local ecosystem dynamics are replicated across a grid of cells that compose the rasterized landscape. Different habitats and land use types translate into different modules and parameter sets. Spatial hydrologic modules link the cells together. They are also part of the LHEM and define hori- zontal fluxes of material and information.
In Chapter 4, Villa et al. discuss the calibration problem. Solving the problem of calibrating large, spatially explicit ecological models to known data and hy- potheses is a challenge to the computing power of the fastest workstations and to the sophistication of the best optimization algorithms. The authors present a method that considers the problems of calibrating unit models to data at different sites using different formulations of the Model Performance Index (MPI) in a multistage procedure, to identify regions of increasing feasibility in the parameter space. The method uses an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the MPI. The re- sult of the process is a hierarchically inclusive set of regions in the multidimen- sional parameter space where the model’s behavior satisfies increasingly strin- gent calibration constraints.
Moving from calibration of spatially uniform unit models to calibration of spa- tial models is yet another challenge. The MPI and other optimization techniques become inapplicable because of the enormous computer effort that would be re- quired to run such optimizations over all of the cells in a spatially explicit model. Most of the calibration efforts in the spatial implementations are therefore still based on the trial-and-error approach, in which the skills and experience of the modeler becomes an intrinsic part of the calibration effort. By applying these skills and the “educated-guess” approach, we can considerably limit the parame- ter space and the number of model runs that would be required to fit the model to the available data. However, this fit is unlikely to be the best one; it will be just an approximation that can always use additional refinement.
Part II of the book is a collection of several diverse case studies, in which spa- tially explicit dynamic models have been created to resolve some very important ecological and management problems. All of the models employ the SME approach.
Chapter 5 examines habitat shifts in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya deltas in coastal Louisiana. Using spatial models, Reyes et al. examine land loss and yearly shifts of marsh habitats. The landscape model also served as a tool to analyze a se- ries of weather scenarios under diverse sea-level rise rates. The landscape model integrated several individual modules at different scales. The physical module consists of a vertically integrated hydrodynamic model that moves and disperses salt and sediment. This was coupled with a process-based biological model of aboveground and belowground productivity and soil building. The coupling of spatial and temporal scales was a salient issue due to the size of the model. Resul- tant land elevation and habitat characteristics were updated annually and fed back into the hydrodynamic model. Simulations of land loss/creation and spatial vari- ability of marsh types were validated against historical habitat maps. Future effects of weather and eustatic sea-level rise were evaluated for a 30-year projection start- ing in 1988. Results suggested that weather variability had the greatest impacts. The model strength lies in predicting the effects of regional management plans such as water diversions and structural-landscape-level changes.
In Chapter 6, Fitz et al. apply a similar approach to another predominantly wet- land area—the Everglades in Florida. Water management infrastructure and oper-ations has fragmented the greater Everglades into separate, impounded basins, al- tering flows and hydropatterns in these internationally recognized wetlands. This combination of altered hydrology and water quality has interacted to degrade vegetative habitats and other ecological characteristics of the Everglades. As part of a massive plan to “restore” the Everglades, simulation models are being ap- plied to better understand the system’s hydrologic and ecological dynamics, to help evaluate options for restoration. One such tool is the Everglades Landscape Model (ELM), a process-based, spatially explicit simulation of ecosystem dy- namics across this heterogeneous 10,000-km2 region.
The ELM model does an excellent job of reproducing the historical spatio- temporal dynamics of hydrology, surface-water and groundwater phosphorus, pe- riphyton biomass and community type, macrophyte biomass and habitat type, and peat accumulation. Phosphorus loading throughout the Everglades system was then evaluated under two base scenarios. The 1995 base case assumed current management operations, with phosphorus inflow concentrations fixed at their long-term, historical average. The 2050 base case assumed future modifications in water management, with all managed inflows to the Everglades having reduced phosphorus concentrations (due to filtering by constructed wetlands). The ELM fills a critical information need in Everglades management and has become an ac- cepted tool in evaluating scenarios of potential restoration of the natural system.
Chapter 7 is an application of the SME approach to an aquatic system by Behm et al. They investigate the role that estuarine processes play in altering the spatial distribution and abundance of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) in the Great Bay Es- tuary, New Hampshire, USA. A unit model was developed to simulate interac- tions of eelgrass with environmental variables and other organisms. These vari- ables include epiphytic algae, phytoplankton, macroalgae, detritus, consumers, and nutrients. A spatial simulation model was then used to simulate the annual as well as the spatial production of eelgrass habitats. A hydrology model developed by the University of New Hampshire Ocean Engineering Center was linked to the spatial model to drive the transfer of materials from adjacent cells. Using data ob- tained for river inputs of nutrients, the authors were able to simulate the seasonal and spatial variation in eelgrass production. Model results showed that both light attenuation and nutrient supply have a significant impact on eelgrass distribution. The spatial model was manipulated to test the effects of nutrient loading on inter- actions of eelgrass with other variables.
From wetlands and aquatic systems we then move to mostly terrestrial landscapes. In Chapter 8, Voinov et al. describe the Patuxent Landscape Model (PLM), which was designed to simulate fundamental ecological processes on the watershed scale. It has also been linked to an economic model that generated possible scenarios of land use change. The PLM was assembled based on modules from LHEM. Different habitats and land use types translate into different parameter sets. The model describes the 2352 km2 of the Patuxent River watershed in Maryland and integrates data and knowledge over several spatial, temporal, and complexity scales, and it serves as an aid to regional management. In particular, the model addresses the effects of both the magnitude and spatial patterns of human settlements and agricultural practices on hydrology, plant productivity,and nutrient cycling in the landscape. The spatial resolution is variable, with a maximum of 30 m  30 m tested on several subwatersheds. The finer resolution allows adequate depiction of the pattern of ecosystems and human settlement on the landscape. The temporal resolution is different for various components of the model, ranging from hourly time steps in the hydrologic sector to yearly time steps in the economic land use transition module.
A modular, multiscale approach was used to calibrate and test the model. Model results show good agreement with data for several components of the model at several scales. A range of scenarios with the calibrated model shows the implica- tions of past and alternative future land use patterns and policies. The 18 scenarios analyzed include (1) historical land use in 1650, 1850, 1950, 1972, 1990, and 1997, (2) a “buildout” scenario based on fully developing all the land currently zoned for development, (3) four future development patterns based on an empiri- cal economic land use conversion model, (4) agricultural “best management prac- tices” that lower fertilizer application, (5) four “replacement” scenarios of land use change to analyze the relative contributions of agriculture and urban land uses, and (6) two “clustering” scenarios with significantly more and less clustered residen- tial development than the current pattern. Results indicate the complex nature of the landscape response and the need for spatially explicit modeling.
In Chapters 9 and 10, SME was closely integrated with Geographic Resources Analysis Support Systems (GRASS)—another open source, public-domain soft- ware package. GRASS is a geographic information system that provides a wealth of functionality for instantaneous spatial data analysis and processing. SME adds dynamics to the model. The marriage of the two software systems offers much power and promise for complex spatial modeling.
In Chapter 9, Trame-Shapiro et al. use the SME modeling approach to describe the population dynamics of two endangered bird species: the vireo and the war- bler. The studies are performed at Fort Hood, an Army training installation in central Texas. The Fort Hood Avian Simulation Model (FHASM) is a dynamic, spatially explicit model of ecosystem processes and population dynamics. The model simulates changes in vegetation and avian populations across the installa- tion ( 88,000 ha) over 100-year intervals (although shorter or longer runs are easily accommodated). The user designates management policies for each simu- lation run.
The Fort Hood Avian Simulation Model (FHASM) was used to generate prob- abilities of extinction for Fort Hood populations of the vireo and warbler under various scenarios, in a procedure known as population viability analysis (PVA). To do so, portions of FHASM were eliminated, and the resulting, simplified model became FHASM-V. Two applications are described here. First, FHASM-V was compared to a 1996 model designed for use in population viability analyses workshops of the vireo and warbler. Demographic variables of the two models were matched as much as possible. Second, a comparison was made among pro- jected long-term probability of survival of the two species under three different habitat protection policies, using FHASM-V alone. Results furnished additional information for endangered species policy on Fort Hood while providing an in- teresting comparison to calculations using the 1996 model. Chapter 10, by Aycrigg et al., is about spatial landscape simulations used to ac- cess impacts on another endangered species, the desert tortoises (Gopherus agas- sizii) in the Mojave Desert, California. This model was also developed at the U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratories (USACERL), Champaign, Illinois, to assess the impacts of military training across time and space. The desert tortoise was designated as federally threatened in the Mojave Desert in 1990. Its patchy distribution over very large areas makes population-density estimates diffi- cult to obtain. It is a long-lived animal that does not reproduce until about 15 years old, making it highly susceptible to perturbations in the environment.
The spatially dynamic habitat model and the desert tortoise model were devel- oped to evaluate the potential response of tortoise density and habitat suitability to changes in the intensity, location, and timing of military training. The model includes mathematical, logical, and stochastic processes. The initial conditions are seeded by the use of a snapshot of the system at some real or artificial start time. Various types of input data are used to seed the model including raster im- ages, vector data, point information, and object status and location. Differences between the output and the seed values reveal the simulated changes within the landscape associated with various land management schemes.
In Chapter 11, Deal et al. develop a spatially explicit model to examine the dy- namic spread of fox rabies across the state of Illinois and to evaluate possible disease-control strategies. The ultimate concern is that the disease will spread from foxes to humans through the pet population. Variables considered, including population densities, fox biology, home ranges, dispersal rates, contact rates, and incubation periods, can greatly affect the spread of disease. The spatial modeling technique used was a grid-based approach that combines the relevant geographic condition of the Illinois landscape (typically described in a georeferenced data- base system) with a nonlinear dynamic model of the phenomena of interest in each cell, interactively connected to the other appropriate cells (usually adjacent ones).
The resulting spatial model graphically links data obtained from previous mod- els (fox biology, rabies information, and landscape parameters) using various hi- erarchical scales. It makes it possible to follow the emergent patterns and facili- tates experimental data collection techniques. Results of the model indicate that the disease would likely spread among the native healthy fox population from east to west and would occur in epidemiological waves radiating from the point of introduction, becoming endemic across the state in about 15 years. It was also found that although current hunting pressures can potentially wipe out the fox in the state, some level of hunting pressure can be effectively utilized to help control the disease.
Finally, in Chapter 12, Seppelt and Voinov explore how optimization can be performed using spatial models. In the other chapters, models were mostly used to run scenarios (i.e., the user first identifies a set of forcing functions or initial conditions) that are then translated into system behavior by applying the models. Optimization procedures allow one to formulate certain goals that we wish the system to achieve and then use the model to translate those goals into control variables and parameters that let us reach those goals. For a mainly agricultural
16 Robert Costanza and Alexey Voinovregion studied in this chapter, the goal, or the performance criterion, was formu- lated as a combination of economic and ecological factors, which combine eco- nomic aspects, such as farmer’s income from harvest, with ecologic aspects, such as nutrient flow from the watershed into the estuary. The task was to find opti- mum land use patterns and rates of fertilizer application to maximize the perfor- mance criterion.
Optimization in spatial modeling is usually prohibitive because of the high computational complexity. The authors developed a framework of procedures for numerical optimization in spatially explicit dynamic ecosystem simulation mod- els that overcomes some of these difficulties. The results were tested using Monte Carlo simulation, which used stochastic generators for the independent control variables. Gradient-free optimization procedures (genetic algorithms) were used to verify the simplifying assumptions. Parts of the framework offer tools for opti- mization, with the computation effort independent of the size of the study area. As a result, important areas with high retention capabilities were identified and fertilizer maps were set up depending on soil properties. It was shown that opti- mization methods, even in complex simulation models, can be a useful tool for a systematic analysis of management strategies of ecosystem use.

#+title: Digital Forms for Himalaya

#+subtitle: A Journal for Nature's Patterns & Rhythms

Nestled in the Western Himalaya, the Parvati valley emerges where the Pir Panjal, and Great Himalayan ranges converge. Here the valley splits the Kullu mountains like a deep gash, it's formation guided by tectonic faults where one mountain chain thrust over another, and carved by millennia of glacial ice and rushing waters. At dawn, when the first light catches the snow-drawped peaks of Deo Tibba and Pin Parvati, the valley transforms into a natural amphitheater of light and shadow. The valley reveals its dramatic geologic heritage --- where metamorphic gneisses of the Greater Himalayas meet the younder rocks of the Pir Panjal. The river below, homonymous with a Hindu goddess, has carved its course along structural weaknesses, tumbling through narrow gorges and over worn boulders, its jade waters carrying both glacial silt and stories of the mountains' violent uplift.

This landscape, where thermal springs burst from deep tectonic faults and cannabis grows wild on abandoned terraces, represents the complex interplay of geological forces, ecological adaptations, and human exploitations that characterizes the entire Himalayan range. Modern man must have set foot in the Himalaya before 10,000 years ago. Over the millenia they settled all habital corners of Earth's tallest mounrain ranges. The Himalaya suffered human presence, with deforestration turning the Tibetan plateau to a cold desert. However, human expansion was always limited by the extreme unpredictability of Himalayan weather and geology. Until we arrive in the modern age. Today, as motorable roads reach deep, hydroelectric projects dam the sacred waters and concrete structures replace traditional timber homes, the valley embodies a crucial questions: how do we reconcile our need to experience, understand and document these mountains with our impact upon them? Despite the sublime experiences they inspire in an individual, modern humanity's /common-market-interest/ has been nothing but detrimental to the mountains.


What does that mean if we travel through the mountains today? What shall we experience? What will inspire us? Computing biodiversity data, or climate data for the Himalaya will definitely be a good learning experience by itself. There must also be several unresolved scientific problems in Himalayan geology, hydrology, meteorology, climatology, or biology. They should be interesting to read and understand using computer models. However, these are /applications/ of scientific methods. I am more interested in elucidating the scientific methods themselves --- mostly to develop my own understanding. Our travels will provide us ample examples to create learning material in the form of computational notebooks, interactive webpages and info-graphics.

I seek to capture not just the mechanics but the music of the mountains - from the crystalline patterns in their stones to the rhythmic cycles of their ecosystems. Through computational art and scientific modeling, I aim to express how life, from the smallest lichen to human settlements, is inseparable from the mountain geology, hydrology, and climate. I am interested in shapes and rhythms of both the natural and imagined worlds. I have studied computational models for the reconstruction and simulation of a mammalian brain. We can apply a similar approach to reconstruct and simulate a mountain ecosystem. The goal is not merely academic scientific development. Many such accounts exist in the literature. I want to also appreciate the sublime that Himalaya inspires in us. I want to develop a personal expression of her sheer beauty using computationally generated art. I want to capture the colorful patterns of it's stones, streams, and snows, and the rhythms of its flora and fauna. Using their stark example, I want to express, in code, and in art, how life is inseparable from air, land, and water. I want to show how biology responds to geological challenges. I want to show how human imagination responds to a towering geography. I want to show how mankind has become a mightier force than terrestrial geology. We will need modeling and data analyses --- but those are just numbers. We will also need art so that our audience can feel the beauty, what it could have been in the past, and what it would mean when it is lost.


* Art & Senses

How can we define art? I think, the definition may be utterly useless beyond literary verbiage. What may be useful, however, is to understand that art manifests itself to the human mind through their senses. Unlike science, no one will pretend that art is objective. All art is first and foremost a sensory experience, only supported by an intellectual effort on the part of the observer. How does art work through human senses? What examples may we consider to explore art's play with human senses?

Science reverses roles of the intellect and the senses. Scientists do use art or artistic elements in their work. They may communicate data using sensorially stimulating visual charts, but to understand their figures we have to follow a legend that provides the rules to analyze the displayed shapes, colors, and sizes. Here, we want to use science (and tech) to do primarily art. How can we use science and technology to create and a guide a virtual but sensory experience of the Himalaya?
